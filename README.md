## Fashion E-commerce Product Success Prediction
This repository contains the code for a small machine learning application developed to predict the success of fashion products for a fashion e-commerce company. The application utilizes historical data on past products and their attributes to train models, which are then used to predict the success of potential products for the upcoming year.
